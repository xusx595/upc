Start this entry as a placeholder for my notes on LNO features. 
I'll try at least to keep a consistent list of features and command 
line options so we can easily update any release notes. 

All the flags shown in this file require at least "upcc --opt" .



Loop Reversal
===============
-LNO:blind_loop_reversal 

Loop Unrolling
==================

Multiple ways to get loops unrolled. It happens either automatically
based on machine models or under user control. 
Since the models are tuned for 
serial code on Itanium-1 (??) it's not necessarily the best way to go.
For fine grained loops that contain communication, a higher degree
of unroll might be desired. 

This degree can be controlled in two ways. 

i. Command line option:  
      upcc --opt -Wu,"-LNO:full_unroll=64" 
   Have to check but I think this is a big hammer that will unroll 
every single loop 64 times.

ii. Within the source, at loop granularity

    #pragma unroll 4
    for(i=0; i < N; i++) 
      .....


Message Vectorization
===================== 

Flags are:  -Wu,"-Wb,-do-msg-vect"


LNO Debugging
==============

The flags I'm using right now are:

-Wu,"-Wb,-trlno"  -Wu,"-Wb,-O3"   -Wu,"-Wb,-tt31:0x614ff07" -Wu,"-Wb,-tt32:0x100703" -Wu,"-Wb,-tt25:0x000c"
